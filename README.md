Impact of Load Times on User Engagement


Does the amount of time that the site takes to load affect the rates of quick exits and bounces? 
Using a logit model, I found that longer load times are actually associated with a smaller probability of bouncing 
and quick exiting. This is contrary to intuition. However, consistent with expectations, first-time users were more 
likely to bounce/exit quickly compared with returning users, and mobile/tablet users were more likely to bounce/exit 
quickly compared with desktop users.
